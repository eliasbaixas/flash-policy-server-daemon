Flash Security Policy Server (www.flash-resources.net)
======================================================

This application contains the main policy file server that serves the policy files and test application for testing the server.


If you have ant, you can build the application by typing ant at the command prompt when in this folder.

You can start the server by making use of the bash script (for linux) and .bat files on windows.

On Windows:

Double click the start-policy-server.bat to start the policy server. 
By default the policy server will serve the default_policy.xml found in the  resources folder.
You will have to edit that policy file to enter the domain you want to give access to with the socket port number.

You can use the config.properties to configure the Server.
